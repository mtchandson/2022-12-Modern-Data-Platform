# Mounting & accessing ADLS Gen2 in Azure Databricks using Service Principal and Secret Scopes

## A guide on accessing Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 from Databricks in Python with Azure Key Vault-backed Secret Scopes and Service Principal.



Azure Data Lake Storage and Azure Databricks are unarguably the backbones of the Azure cloud-based data analytics systems. Azure Data Lake Storage provides scalable and cost-effective storage, whereas Azure Databricks provides the means to build analytics on that storage.

The analytics procedure begins with mounting the storage to Databricks distributed file system (DBFS). There are several ways to mount Azure Data Lake Store Gen2 to Databricks. Perhaps one of the most secure ways is to delegate the Identity and access management tasks to the Azure AD.

This article looks at how to mount Azure Data Lake Storage to Databricks authenticated by Service Principal and OAuth 2.0 with Azure Key Vault-backed Secret Scopes.

**Caution:** *Microsoft Azure is a paid service, and following this article can cause financial liability to you or your organization.*

# Prerequisites

1. An active Microsoft Azure subscription
2. Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account
3. Azure Databricks Workspace (Premium Pricing Tier)
4. Azure Key Vault

To access resources secured by an Azure AD tenant (e.g., storage accounts), a security principal must represent the entity that requires access. A security principal defines the access policy and permissions for a user or an application in the Azure AD tenant. **When an application is permitted to access resources in a tenant (e.g., upon registration), a service principal object is created automatically.**

Let’s begin by registering an Azure AD application to create a service principal and store our application authentication key in the Azure Key Vault instance.

# Register an Azure AD application

Find and select **Azure Active Directory** on the Azure Portal home page. Select **App registrations** and click **+ New registration**.

On the **Register an application** page, enter the name *ADLSAccess*, signifying the purpose of the application, and click **Register**.

In the **ADLSAccess **screen, copy the **Application (client) ID** and the **Directory (tenant) ID** into notepad. Application ID refers to the app we just registered (i.e., ADLSAccess), and the Azure AD tenant our app ADLSAccess is registered to is the Directory ID.

Next, we need to generate an authentication key (aka application password or client secret or application secret) to authenticate the ADLSAccess app. Click on** Certificates and secrets**, and then click **+ New client secret**. On the **Add a client secret** blade, type a description, and expiry of one year, click **Add** when done.

When you click on **Add**, the client secret (authentication key) will appear, as shown in the image below. You only have one opportunity to copy this key-value into notepad. **You will not be able to retrieve it later if you perform another operation or leave this blade**.

# Grant service principal access to ADLS account

Next, we need to assign an access role to our service principal (recall that a service principal is created automatically upon registering an app) to access data in our storage account. Go to the Azure portal home and open the resource group in which your storage account exists. Click **Access Control (IAM)**, on **Access Control (IAM)** page, select **+ Add** and click **Add role assignment**. On the **Add role assignment **blade, assign the **Storage Blob Data Contributor** role to our service principal (i.e., ADLSAccess), as shown below.

# Add application secret to the Azure Key Vault

Go to the Azure portal home and open your key vault. Click **Secrets **to add a new secret; select **+ Generate/Import**. On **Create a secret** blade; give a **Name, **enter the client secret (i.e., **ADLS Access Key** we copied in the previous step) as **Value** and a **Content type** for easier readability and identification of the secret later. Repeat the creation process for the **Application (client) ID** and the **Directory (tenant) ID** we copied earlier. Your vault should have three secrets now.

Select **Properties**, copy the **Vault URI** and **Resource ID** to notepad; we will need them in the next step.

# Create an Azure Key Vault-backed Secret Scope in Azure Databricks

*If you’ve followed our another article on creating a Secret Scope for Azure SQL Server credentials, you don’t have to perform this step as long as your key vault and Databricks instance in question remains the same.*

Go to `https://<DATABRICKS-INSTANCE>#secrets/createScope`and replace <DATABRICKS-INSTANCE> with your actual Databricks instance URL. Create a Secret Scope, as shown below.

> *This URL is case sensitive.*

# Mount ADLS to Databricks using Secret Scope

Finally, it’s time to mount our storage account to our Databricks cluster. Head back to your Databricks cluster and open the notebook we created earlier (or any notebook, if you are not following our entire series).

We will define some variables to generate our connection strings and fetch the secrets using Databricks utilities. You can copy-paste the below code to your notebook or type it on your own. We’re using Python for this notebook. Run your code using controls given at the top-right corner of the cell. Don’t forget to replace the variable assignments with your storage details and secret **Names**.

We can override the default language of a notebook by specifying the language magic command at the beginning of a cell. The supported magic commands are `%python`, `%r`, `%scala`, and `%sql`. Notebooks also support few additional magic commands like `%fs`, `%sh`, and `%md`. We can use `%fs ls` to list the content of our mounted store.

Don’t forget to unmount your storage when you no longer need it.

```
# Unmount only if directory is mounted
if any(mount.mountPoint == mountPoint for mount in dbutils.fs.mounts()):
  dbutils.fs.unmount(mountPoint)
```

Congratulations! You’ve successfully mounted your storage account to Databricks without revealing and storing your application secrets and access keys.

# Conclusion

We looked at how to register a new Azure AD application to create a service principal, assigned access roles to a service principal, and stored our secrets to Azure Key Vault. We created an Azure Key Vault-backed Secret Scope in Azure Dataricks and securely mounted and listed the files stored in our ADLS Gen2 account in Databricks.
